# Question setting app

The Question Setting App is one part of a Location Based Quiz project. It allows an administrator of a Quiz App instance to define and save to a database the location of points of interest and questions related to them, their choices and correct choice. It works together with a mobile application that uses these questions as a [location based quiz app](https://github.com/ucesova/Quiz_App) that asks things to the user related with his/her location. Additionally, both parts are served by an [HTTP node.js server](https://github.com/ucesova/Server).

Go to the [server readme](https://github.com/ucesova/Server/blob/master/README.md) to see further details.
